# EloGrad

**Extended Elo model implementation.**

**EloGrad** leverages the framing of the 
[Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)
as logistic regression with stochastic gradient descent
(see [this blog](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/Elo.html) for a nice walkthrough)
to offer a collection of extensions to the rating system.
All models are `scikit-learn` compatible.
